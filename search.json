    "text": "Open TO Science\nCards and code to create cards for Open‚ù§Ô∏èScience, a educational game based on Apples to Apples. This game can be played in person or online. If you are interested in the printed game, please reach out to us (rdm@vu.nl)\n\n\nGoal of the Game\nIn Open‚ù§Ô∏èScience, players are invited to engage in playful and deep conversations about Open Science. The card game features an encyclopedia of issues that pervade this movement of research reform and ask participants to consider their role and values in changing academic culture. Like Open Science, this game is about connection. Players are meant to look into each other‚Äôs eyes, engage in conversation, and better understand one another.\n\n\nPlaying online\nYou can play with the Open Science Against Humanity deck here.\nOne player needs to start the game and invite the others. To do so, fill in one name and click on ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù.\nIn the ‚ÄúDeck Source‚Äù dropdown menu select Many Decks and for the deck code use DNGZN. Next click on the ‚Äú+‚Äù to add the deck. You will receive a game code that you can share with fellow players. They can join the game by going to https://md.rereadgames.com/games/[game code]\nNote that optional adjustments in the rules and time limits are possible if you have specific preferences.\nNext click on the :loudspeaker: to invite 2 or 3 other players to the game. Once they join, you can start the game!\nWhen you start playing, the rules described in the section above ‚ÄúHow to play‚Äù apply.\nNote that when playing online, you can‚Äôt actually ‚Äúsee‚Äù whether someone played a card, is thinking. Or who is the Reviewer and who is playing (if you are reviewing, you can‚Äôt play a card!). If you are confused about what is happening, press the ‚Äú?‚Äù at the top of the game window. The game will tell you what your role is and what you are supposed to do. If you are playing and have selected a card, do not forget to press the check mark at the bottom right of the screen to send the card to the pile of played cards.\nIf you click on the top left ‚ÄúShow or hide the scoreboard‚Äù, you can see the status and roles during each round. But also, don‚Äôt forget to keep talking to each other :game_die: :ghost: :smiley: :game_die:\n\n\nHow to Play\nüßç3-7 players ‚è∞ 30 - 75 minutes üèãÔ∏è difficulty level: researcher friendly\nPlayers start with a hand of seven white cards featuring concepts pertinent to Open Science, which are contextualised via their corresponding link. A player is selected to be the first judge, and that judge plays a red card, which presents a larger Open Science topic. The round is won by playing the white card that the judge determines to be the match for the red card. The role of the judge rotates, and the number of rounds is determined by the number of players.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis game was created by the GHOST Collective, Games of Horror for Open Science Training.
